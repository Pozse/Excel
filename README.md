# Excel
This VBA script syncs data and formatting between **"Master"** and **"Device Information"** when a user selects a cell in **B2:Q14**. It also monitors **Q9**, changing its color based on input and prompting users if `"No"` is selected. If needed, it opens a hidden hyperlink to the **Go-Back** sheet, ensuring workflow automation.
